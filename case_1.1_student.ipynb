You might be used to seeing files with names like \"Essay(2)(2)\\_FINAL(2)\\_edits2March(3).docx\" as you try to keep different versions of a file in sync while it is being changed by multiple people. Git solves this problem by tracking changes as specific **commits**, allowing you to go back in time to previous versions, and merge versions of files worked on by different people.\n","\n","Git is an advanced and highly complex tool with a steep learning curve, so don't worry if not everything makes sense from the start. You'll only need to learn a few concepts to start using Git.

Python allows users to easily manipulate data and store values in what are known as <b>objects</b>. Everything in Python is an object and has a <b>type</b>. \n","\n","For example, if a user aims to store the integer 5 in an object named ```my_int```, this can be accomplished by writing the Python statement, ```my_int = 5```. If you're used to syntax from mathematics, this can seem confusing. In this case `my_int` is a variable, much like you might find in algebra, but the `=` sign is for _assignment_ not _equality_ (the latter is denoted with `==`). So in this case `my_int = 5` should be taken to mean something more like `Let my_int be equal to 5` rather than `my_int is equal to 5`.\n","\n","Here, `my_int` is an example of a _variable_ because it can change value (we could later assign a different value to it) and it is of type Integer, known in Python simply as `int`. Unlike some other programming languages, Python guesses the type of the variable from the value that we assign, so we do not need to specify the type of the variable explicitly.\n","\n","Python variables have a variety of data types. If you are used to using Microsoft Excel, this is similar to how Excel distinguishes between data types such as Text, Number, Currency, Date, or Scientific. Here are some common data types that you will come across in Python:\n","\n","1. Integers, type ```int```: ```my_int = 1```\n","2. Float type ```float```: ```my_float = 25.5```\n","3. Strings, type ```str```: ```my_string = 'Hello'```\n","\n","Note that the names `my_int`, `my_float` and `my_string` are arbitrary here. While it is useful to name your variables so that the names contain some information about what they are used for, this code would be functionally identical to if we had used `x`, `xrtqp2` and `my_very_long_variable_name`, respectively.\n","\n","Here we see (1) <b>integers</b> and (2) <b>floats</b> store numeric data.  The difference between the two is that floats store decimal variables (fractions), whereas the integer type can only store integer variables (whole numbers). Finally, (3) is the <b>string</b> type. Strings are used to store textual data in Python (a string of one or more characters). Later in this case we will use string variables to store country names. They are often used to store identifiers such as person names, city names, and more.\n","\n","There are other data types available in Python; however, these are the three fundamental types that you will see across almost every Python program. Always keep in mind that **every** object in Python has a type and some of these \"types\" can be custom-defined by the user, which is one of the benefits of Python.\n","\n","The simplest use of Python is as a calculator. We have seen how to assign values to variables, but we can also carry out computations on these variables. A Python program contains one or more lines of code, which are executed in a top-down fashion (with some exceptions that we'll come across later). The following Python program demonstrates this functionality:\n","\n","```\n","x = 5\n","y = 7\n","z = x + y -1 \n","print(z)\n","```\n","\n","The `print` function simply outputs data to your screen (it has nothing to do with a computer printer, and won't waste your ink or paper!). In the code above, we start at the top and work down. This means we assign the value `5` to the variable `x`, then the value `7` to the variable `y` and finally the sum of the values `x` and `y` minus `1` to the variable `z`. Make sure that you can create this Python program and that you get the output `11` before you continue.\n","\n","There is a lot more to Python than the above. In this case, we will introduce you to more basic Python concepts. If you prefer, you can first go through the more extensive [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html) and/or the [W3School Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) and practice more fundamental concepts before proceeding with this case.

Before, we showed how variables could contain simple data types like a single integer, or a string. As an extension of that, variables can also refer to **data structures**. These are more complicated data types that comprise many single pieces of data, organized in a specific way.\n","\n","As before, we use `=`, the **assignment operator**, to assign a value to the variable. \n","\n","Python's dictionary type stores a mapping of key-value pairs that allow users to quickly access information for a particular key.

Lists are versatile and can be expanded by adding new elements to the end of the list (the right-most side is considered the end of the list).

Python continues to be an outstanding tool to perform data-driven analysis and deliver key business insights."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ms2dRZ4KSkrm","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"outputId":"29ae8065-e137-4503-d3ea-174b3a49364c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1590434883145,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":734,"user":{"displayName":"Jose Jhon Fredy Gonzalez Veloza","photoUrl":"","userId":"06629063487883524661"}}},"source":["%cd '/content/drive/My Drive/CURSOS/MINTIC Ciencia de datos/00 - PreWork/case 1-1'"],"execution_count":88,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/My Drive/CURSOS/MINTIC Ciencia de datos/00 - PreWork/case 1-1\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TCOwf5mBS9So","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"outputId":"ed43a0b4-45fc-432e-e902-5c4637840ce2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1590434892314,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1706,"user":{"displayName":"Jose Jhon Fredy Gonzalez Veloza","photoUrl":"","userId":"06629063487883524661"}}},"source":["! git init"],"execution_count":89,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Initialized empty Git repository in /content/drive/My Drive/CURSOS/MINTIC Ciencia de datos/00 - PreWork/case 1-1/.git/\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CHLLFETwT8MI","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":272},"outputId":"098af85b-437e-4758-dd24-64345f678353","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1590434989512,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":5501,"user":{"displayName":"Jose Jhon Fredy Gonzalez Veloza","photoUrl":"","userId":"06629063487883524661"}}},"source":["! git status"],"execution_count":90,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["On branch master\n","\n","No commits yet\n","\n","Untracked files:\n","  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n","\n","\t\u001b[31mInstructions+for+case1-1.pdf\u001b[m\n","\t\u001b[31mcase_1.1_answers.zip\u001b[m\n","\t\u001b[31mcase_1.1_answers/\u001b[m\n","\t\u001b[31mcase_1.1_student.zip\u001b[m\n","\t\u001b[31mcase_1.1_student/\u001b[m\n","\n","nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-xnb2A0UUfeg","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["! git add case_"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
